# Sims 2 Accessibility

A screen reader accessibility mod for **The Sims 2 Legacy Collection** (Steam, 2025): every screen,
dialog and panel spoken through NVDA, JAWS or Narrator, one set of keys everywhere, and the tools a
blind player needs (the lot's things, a lot map with sound cues, a narrator, furniture spots, a
build cursor).

## For players

- Download `Sims2AccessibilityInstaller.exe` from the
  [latest release](https://github.com/gomods1/sims2/releases/latest) and run it: it finds the game
  through Steam and installs, updates or uninstalls the mod. Or unzip `Sims2Access-vX.Y.Z.zip`
  into the game's `EP9\TSBin` folder (the one with `Sims2EP9.exe`).
- The mod needs a screen reader (NVDA, JAWS or Narrator) and the current Steam version of the game.
- In the game: **Control+F1** says the keys of the screen you are on, **Control+Shift+F1** opens
  the manual in your browser, in the game's language. The main screen also ends with a "mod help"
  group holding both.
- The manual: [docs/manual/en.md](docs/manual/en.md) (English source; the other languages sit next
  to it as `<language tag>.md`).

## For developers

- `CLAUDE.md`: how the mod is built, what is known about the game, the working rules.
- `NAVIGATION.md`: the one key grammar every screen follows. `ROADMAP.md`: what is done and next.
- `mod\build.bat [deploy]` builds the mod and the manual (pandoc); `python tools/package.py
  vX.Y.Z` packages it locally (with an offline installer). Pushing a `vX.Y.Z` tag builds and
  publishes a release on GitHub (`.github/workflows/release.yml`).
- **Keys and docs change together**: a change to a key or a feature edits, in the same change, the
  code, the `Keys*` strings Control+F1 speaks (`mod/core/util/strings_table.h` and every
  `mod/core/lang/*.cpp`), and the manual in every language (`docs/manual/*.md`).
  `python tools/build_docs.py --check` and `python tools/mod_strings.py check` find what a
  translation left out; a release stops when the manual's translations differ from the English.
