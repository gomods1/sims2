"""Attach a Frida script to the running Sims2EP9.exe for a bounded time and print its messages.

  python frida_run.py <script.js[,more.js]> [seconds=20] [--drive <python-file>] [--speech|--speech-mute]

Scripts send() plain strings or objects; both are printed one per line. Sims2EP9.exe addresses in
scripts should be reported as preferred-base VAs (0x400000 + offset) so they match Ghidra and
CLAUDE.md; tools/frida/common.js has helpers for that.
--drive runs a Python file while the script is attached, with `script` (the Frida script) and
`rpc` (its exports_sync) in its globals, to drive the game; see tools/drive_*.py.
--speech starts mod/out/SpeechHost.exe for the game PID before attaching (combine with
frida/speech.js so scripts can say()); --speech-mute does the same but SpeechHost only logs the
lines (mod/out/SpeechHost.log) without speaking. Speech talks through the user's screen reader:
ask before using --speech.
